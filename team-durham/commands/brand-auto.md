# /brand-auto — Bounded Autonomous Brand Execution

Run a brand task from start to finish with bounded autonomy. Brand-orchestrator
routes to the right Durham specialist, the specialist executes one bounded
slice, Munari/Rubin verify, and the outcome writes to Allura Brain.

## When to Use

- You want the Durham team to handle a brand task end-to-end
- The task is well-defined (audit, copy pack, visual direction, QA)
- You trust the team to make non-shipping brand decisions autonomously
- You want the outcome logged to Brain for future brand work

## Layering

```
brand-loop (META)     → finds or crafts the right brand loop
  ↓ hands off a bounded brand task
Durham agents          → execute the brand work, return evidence
  ↓ writes outcome
Allura Brain          → canonical memory (group_id="allura-team-durham")
```

Load the `brand-loop` skill (`skills/brand-loop/SKILL.md`) for the full contract.

## Execution Protocol

### Phase 0: Context Detection

Determine the brand execution environment:

1. **API mode** — called via POST → full autonomous, no UI
2. **Claude auto mode** — user has auto-approval → autonomous non-shipping steps
3. **Interactive** — user is present → DAY_BUILD with auto-approved non-shipping steps

Log to Brain if available:

```javascript
allura-brain_memory_add({
  group_id: "allura-team-durham",
  user_id: "brand-auto",
  content: "BRAND_AUTO started: <task>",
  metadata: { source: "brand-auto", event_type: "BRAND_AUTO_START" }
})
```

### Phase 1: Scout Recon (Mandatory, Read-Only)

Before any action, dispatch Scout-recon for brand context:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "Explore", prompt: "Scout recon for brand task: <task>. Find locked brand strategy, brand-kit state, existing copy/visual packs, and governance rules. Report file paths and current state.")
```

Scout report informs specialist routing. This step is non-negotiable.

### Phase 2: Specialist Routing

Brand-orchestrator analyzes the task + Scout report to route to the specialist:

| Task Signal | Specialist | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| "strategy", "positioning", "STP" | Aaker / Kotler | New brand brief, positioning review |
| "visual", "logo", "color", "tokens" | Glaser / Rand | Visual direction, identity work |
| "copy", "voice", "messaging", "tagline" | Ogilvy | Copy pack, voice guide, taglines |
| "QA", "compliance", "audit", "consistency" | Munari | Brand compliance audit |
| "taste", "editorial", "review", "refine" | Rubin | Editorial taste gate |
| Multi-phase | Brand-orchestrator | Full pipeline (all specialists) |

Log the routing decision:

```
[BRAND-AUTO] Specialist: Munari (QA audit task)
[BRAND-AUTO] Strategy: single-pass QA audit
```

### Phase 3: Execute One Bounded Slice

The routed specialist executes **one bounded brand slice** — the smallest
reversible brand change:

1. Load the relevant brand context (locked strategy, brand kit, voice rules)
2. Produce one deliverable (QA report, copy pack, visual direction, taste review)
3. Do not ship externally — produce the artifact only

### Phase 4: Brand Verification Gate (Mandatory)

Run an **explicit brand check** before declaring done:

- **Munari QA gate** — brand compliance rubric (tokens, voice, visual rules)
- **Rubin taste gate** — editorial taste review (clarity, concision, voice)
- **Brand-kit consistency check** — does the artifact match locked strategy?

If no check is known, **ask the user**. "Looks good" is not acceptable.

### Phase 5: Destructive / Ship Gate

Even in brand-auto mode, STOP for:

- Publishing brand kit externally
- Sending client-facing material
- Changing locked brand strategy or positioning
- Modifying brand governance rules or agent definitions
- Deleting brand assets

Surface the action, explain the risk, and wait for explicit approval. This is
the only pause point in brand-auto mode.

### Phase 6: Completion

1. Run final brand verification (Munari QA + Rubin taste if applicable)
2. Log outcome to Brain:

```javascript
allura-brain_memory_add({
  group_id: "allura-team-durham",
  user_id: "brand-auto",
  content: "BRAND_LOOP_OUTCOME: <task>. Terminal state: <success|clean no-op|blocked|approval-required|exhausted|stagnated>. Specialist: <agent>. Evidence: <QA/taste result>",
  metadata: { source: "brand-auto", event_type: "BRAND_AUTO_COMPLETE", specialist: "<agent>", terminal_state: "<state>" }
})
```

3. Report summary: what was done, what artifact was produced, what gates passed, terminal state reached

## Terminal States

Every run ends in exactly one. **Never report an error or exhausted budget as success.**

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **success** | Brand goal achieved, QA + taste gates passed |
| **clean no-op** | Inspected brand state, nothing needed, no change made |
| **blocked** | Hard blocker — missing brief, locked strategy unavailable, missing asset |
| **approval-required** | Next action ships brand externally and needs HITL |
| **exhausted** | Iteration budget consumed without convergence |
| **stagnated** | No measurable progress across N iterations |

## Rules

1. **Scout first, always** — never execute brand work without recon
2. **Specialist routing** — brand-orchestrator routes, specialists execute
3. **Ship = pause** — the only exception to full autonomy is external shipping
4. **Bounded iterations** — never loop forever, always have a max (default 8)
5. **Brain logging** — if Allura is available, log start/complete/decisions
6. **Taste gate** — after brand work, verify with Munari/Rubin rubric
7. **Graceful degradation** — if Brain is unavailable, continue without memory (log to console)
8. **group_id = "allura-team-durham"** on every Brain operation — never `allura-system`
